<h1>Story</h1>
<i>Raiden Ei (Japanese: 雷電影, Eng.Raiden Ei, Beelzebul and "Shadow of Thunder and Lightning" or "Shadow of Thunder and Lightning"), also known by his name Archon- Beelzebub, is the Deity of Eternity, and the current Electro-Archon who rules Inazuma. She is a member of the Seven Archons. She wanders the world as Shogun Raiden.
Beelzebub's twin sister, Baal, or Raiden Makoto, died during a Cataclysm 500 years ago. Since then, Amy has assumed the duties of Shogun Inazuma, and continued to rule under the name of Baal.

Since Ei retired to meditate in the Realm of Eutyumiya, her puppet "Shogun Raiden" led Inazuma and made decisions about everything that happened in Inazuma. She is responsible for "Hunting the Eye of God". After the events of the second act of the chapter, Ei decided to abandon the idea of eternity and meditation in the Realm of Euthyumia, and work together with a doll that has its own consciousness to lead Inazuma to prosperity.

Makoto and Ei were twin goddesses who won the Archon War together. When Makoto established the shogunate in Inazuma, Ei became her kagemusei (Japanese: 影武者 "Shadow Warrior"), or doppelganger. Ei became her kagemusha (Japanese: 影武者 "shadow warrior") nobody knew about the existence of two twin sisters.

After Makoto's death, Ei stayed inside the Realm of Eutyumiya, and allowed her puppet, the Shogun, to control Inazuma, based on the views of Ei herself at that time.
<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>"Seven ideals for seven archons, and of them Eternity is closest to the Heavenly Order."
    — Beelzebub, as quoted by Zhong Li</p>
Based on her various descriptions, Ei is portrayed as quite egocentric and boastful: she claims that her ideal is "Closest to the heavenly order", calls her body "The noblest and most outstanding of all in this world" and considers her reign eternal. She is noble in her behavior, but because of the losses she suffered during the Cataclysm, and because of the fear of erosion that could occur, she decided to move to the Realm of Euthymia to meditate, reflect and preserve the "eternity" that she always remembered. While she is slow to acknowledge that change is inevitable, she also has a curious outlook on life these days. It is shown that it is relatively slow to catch trends.

A year before the events of the game, Ei began to perceive Visions as divine blessings, believing that they should be under the exclusive dominion of the deity and that those who are not controlled by her pose a threat to her "eternal" rule. Being deceived by Fatui, she initiated a Decree on the Hunt for the Eyes of God in order to capture most, if not all, of the Visions in her domain and give them to the statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.

As for the current events of the game, a whole year has passed since the Electro-Eye appeared in Teivat. In a conversation between Ei and Yae Miko in the Kingdom of Eutyumia, it was said that this happened because Ei believed that people pursuing their dreams and aspirations would bring them more suffering and loss. However, when the Traveler asks about this, Ei explains that the Archons do not actually control the appearance of Visions, and in fact she was also surprised by this fact.

<h2>The past</h2>
After Baal died 500 years ago during a Cataclysm, Beelzebub took the place of Shogun Raiden and continued to rule under the name of Baal. Residents of Inazuma, who did not know about the existence of the twin sister of the Electro-Archon, did not notice the change of the shogun. The losses suffered left a deep mark on Ei's heart and she began to strive for the ideal of "unchanging eternity".[6] And she herself remained in the Realm of Euthyumia and allowed her puppet to manage Inazuma's daily affairs.

Before the cataclysm
Little is known about the history of the twin goddesses Makoto and Ei. As you know, only seven could ascend to the divine abode. Ei sacrificed her body so that Makoto could become an archon. After some time, Makoto, with the help of her divine power, created a new body for Ei, called her sister's consciousness there.Two twin goddesses won the war together before they decided to "split up" — Makoto served as the de facto ruler of Inazuma and was officially an Electro-Archon, Ei became her kagemusya (in Japanese: 影武者 "Shadow Warrior") and was the commander-in-chief of the shogunate army and engaged in military affairs and participated in battles, while Baal preferred to stay away from the battlefield and be closer to her subjects and help them. They ran Inazuma together.Together with his sister, they negotiated, managed the yard, gave orders. Ei was very close to Sasayuri, Mikoshi Chiyo, Kitsune Saigu and Yae Miko. She also contacted Morax and Barbatos, accompanying Makoto to one of the Seven's chance meetings. Another god, Orobashi, was left alone as long as he respected the boundaries of the shogunate. For unknown reasons, he inexplicably attacked Yasiori Island, unleashing a brutal war between the Watatsumi people and the Inazuma mainland, in which Ei participated. During the war, Sasayuri was killed in battle, while Ei finished off Orobashi himself with the help of Muso no Hitotachi. Because of her winning blow, the Musojin Gorge appeared. She then killed the Kanna Kapatsiri (Thunderbird) either because of the danger the bird posed to the island of Seirai, or because of the obstruction of its "eternity". Due to the fall of the bird's body, a crater formed on the island. These exploits are still told to children by their mothers before going to bed.

<h2>During the cataclysm</h2>
During the Cataclysm, the threat of the Abyss prompted Ei to take up arms again, along with Makoto, Chiyo and Saigu. Tie was swallowed by the "beast of sin"; while she escaped, she was tainted by darkness and drew her sword against Ei. In the ensuing fight, Ei cut off Chiyo's right horn and her right hand with a sword, but did not chase after Oni. Around the same time, Saigu was killed during the confrontation with the Abyss, and some time later Makoto was killed. After returning from the campaign, Ei took her sister's place in both the Shogunate and the Seven. The cataclysm left a severe trauma in her soul. After her sister's death, Ei inherited her sword. Makoto gave him the name Musu isshin, and wished him to witness Inazuma, beautiful as a dream, and noble hearts living in this world. Ei did not change her name, as she loved to admire the scenery with her sister. When the blade first turned red, it was thrown aside by the wild wind and thunder.

<h2>After the cataclysm</h2>
At some point after the Cataclysm, Ei created an experimental doll as a proof of concept to see if she could "escape" the erosion by giving her the name Kunikuzushi. Kunikuzushi was not very successful; Ei, clearly taking pity on him, decided to seal his powers and release him to the countryside of Inazuma, where he would eventually be discovered by Fatui and then take the name Scaramucci. She soon created a doll version of herself, making sure she followed her ideals before transferring her consciousness to Muso isshin with what she learned from Yae. Ei didn't know where to put her God's Heart before going to Euthymia. At first she wanted to use the hearts as a power source for the doll, but nothing worked out for her. Then she turned to her familiar, the cunning kitsune Yae Miko. Then Yae joked: "Aren't you afraid that I'll just sell it?". Ei replied: "You understand the value of God's Heart. Even if you sell it, I believe that you will exchange it for something of equal value, and this is not easy." Miko said: "It's your idea, not mine. Look, don't regret it." Such was the tacit agreement between two old friends. When the doll was ready, she asked Ei: "If you leave your body, there will be no way back. Are you sure you won't regret it? The fact that you exist is my answer to this question." Then Ei became the consciousness that is stored in the sword. This is how the "Kingdom of Euthyumia" arose.

<h2>In Euthymia</h2>
One day, while meditating in the Realm of Eutyumiya, Ei had a dream where there was only her and Shogun Raiden in the mirror. The puppet said: "The eternity that you decided to establish in your heart has been shaken by countless desires of people. Thus, you have become my enemy." When Ei created the doll, she thought through all the scenarios, even the worst. She understood that she could become the enemy of eternity, but she had to continue regardless of all external factors. The Puppet's words were what Beelzebub was asking herself: "You think you're more convinced now than you were yesterday, and that's why you're right now. Is it so? Do you have new ideas, or have you also become a victim of inexorable erosion?" Their faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. The struggle with yourself, with your past, will come someday. But she knew she wasn't ready for that yet.

<h2>Present time</h2>
A year before the current events of the game, the Ei doll was deceived by Fatui and adopted a Decree on Hunting for the Eyes of God, "Sakoku", closing its nation from the rest of Teiwat. According to Zhong Li, the mortal vessel of Morax, she ordered the Inazuma shogunate to collect all the Eyes in the country, where they were placed in a Statue of a hundred-armed Deity for unknown reasons. In addition, no one, not even people born outside of Inazuma, has received a single Electro Eye of God since the decree was issued. Paymon also notes that a year ago everything was not so bad.

During the Rite of Descent, Morax faked his death to see if Li Yue could survive without him. He guessed that Beelzebub would find out about his "death", which would force her to accelerate her plans.

During the Ceremony of taking the God's Eye from Toma, the Shogun takes the Traveler to the Kingdom of Eutyumiya, where he meets with Ei. In this fight, she defeats him, but the Traveler manages to escape, thanks to Toma's intervention. Trying to figure out the situation in Inazuma, they meet with Yae, who reveals that the shogun is a puppet. The one they saw in the Kingdom of Euthymia was Beelzebub herself, called "Ei", who showed interest in them. After defeating her once again with the help of the desires and dreams of the captured Eyes of God, Ei agreed to cancel the Hunt for the Eyes of God and returned all the captured Eyes to their owners. Upon learning of the full extent of Fatui's chaos in Inazuma, she immediately ordered the commissioners of the Tenre and Kanjo commissions to be put under house arrest and began to change the shogun's protocols in accordance with her new ideas about Eternity.

After completing the 2nd chapter of the legend quest, Shogun Raiden removes the storms around Inazuma, thereby Ei cancels the Sakoku decree (closing the borders of Inazuma) and regulates the rules of the Kanjo Commission.</i></b></i></div></center><img align=left src="https://i.ibb.co/vw9SfZg/1626017831-9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c.png" alt="1626017831-9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c" border="0"><img align=right src="https://i.ibb.co/vw9SfZg/1626017831-9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c.png" alt="1626017831-9778d5d219c5080b9a6a17bef029331c" border="0">
